Here's a refined and grammatically polished version of your text, while keeping the fun and informal tone intact:

**In this exercise, we will create a simple lottery game where the user can buy a ticket by choosing a number.**  
Our *sophisticated* machine will then randomly generate a winning number.  
If the user's ticket number matches the winning number — **they win the lottery!**  

This exercise will help you practice:
- User input
- Random number generation
- Basic control flow

### 📄 First, let's create the documentation

We’re building a mini online **Roulette** game.

The program will ask the user to provide a number between **1 and 36**.  
It **must** be a valid number.  

⚠️ No strings, floats, `NaN`, `undefined`, or any of that nonsense.  
Keep that weird stuff to yourself. 😄

### 🎰 Game Logic

Once we receive a valid number from the user, our system will generate a random number in the same range.  

Now it’s time to compare the two numbers:

- If the numbers **match** → 🎉 The user is a **winner**!
- If the numbers **don’t match** → ❌ The user **loses the chance**.
