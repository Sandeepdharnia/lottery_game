# lottery_game

In this exercise, we will create a simple lottery game where the user can buy a ticket with a chosen number. 
Our sophisticated machine will then randomly generate a winning number. 
If the user's ticket number matches the winning number, 
they win the lottery! This exercise will help you practice working with user input, random number generation, and basic control flow.
